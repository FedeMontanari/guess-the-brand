# NextJS minigame

Small project I made to play around with the [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) library.

Consists of a minigame where you have to guess the brand/company name off of their logo.

For each correct answer you get a point.

Get as many points as you can and share your high score with your friends.

So far the game has two modes:
- Normal
- Timed

### Normal mode

In this game mode you get 3 lives represented as hearts, when you guess incorrectly you lose a life. Lose all of them and the game is over.

### Timed mode

In this game mode instead of lives you have limited time.

    TO DO: Add the option to select a time bracket(120s, 60s, 30s, 10s)


#### On the works

- Leaderboard
- Easier score sharing(Socials, generated link, etc).
